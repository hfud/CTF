# Description:
- Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important.

- Can you **ssh** as **ctf-player** to **titan.picoctf.net** at port **62426** to get the flag? You'll also need the password **1ad5be0d**. If asked, accept the fingerprint with **yes**. If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: https://webshell.picoctf.org If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell

# Hints:
1. https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh
2. You can try logging in 'as' someone with `<user>`@titan.picoctf.net
3. How could you specify the port?
4. Remember, passwords are hidden when typed into the shell
