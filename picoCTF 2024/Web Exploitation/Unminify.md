# Description:
- I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

# Hints:
1. Try **CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U** in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try **curl `<URL>`** in your shell.
2. Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
3. What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.
